        <a href="#first">The manga spawned a media franchise. It was adapted into three different anime TV series in
            1973, 1979, and 2005. Additionally, Shin-Ei Animation has produced over forty animated films, including two
            3D computer-animated films, all of which are distributed by Toho. Various types of merchandise and media
            have been developed, including soundtrack albums, video games, and musicals. The manga series was licensed
            for an English language release in North America, via Amazon Kindle, through a collaboration of Fujiko F.
            Fujio Pro with Voyager Japan and AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an
            English-language release in North America in 2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and
            Africa.</a>
        <a href="#second">Nobita Nobi is a ten-year-old Japanese school boy who is kind-hearted and honest, but also
            lazy, clumsy, and hapless, performing poorly in both school and sports. One day, a blue robot cat from the
            22nd century named Doraemon is sent back to the past by Nobita's future great-great-grandson, Sewashi Nobi,
            to take care of Nobita so that his descendants can have a better life. Doraemon has a four-dimensional
            pocket in which he stores tools, inventions, and gadgets from the future to aid Nobita whenever he is faced
            with a problem. Although Doraemon is a cat robot, he has a fear of mice because of an incident where robotic
            mice chewed off his ears. This is why Doraemon lost his original yellow color and turned blue, from
            sadness.</a>
        <a href="#third">Nobita has three main friends: Takeshi Goda (nicknamed Gian), Suneo Honekawa (Gian's sidekick),
            and Shizuka Minamoto, Nobita's best friend and love-interest. Gian is a strong, leading and domineering boy,
            but also loyal to his friends. Suneo is a wealthy and spoiled boy who uses his friendship with Gian to win
            the respect of other schoolmates. Shizuka is a gentle and kind girl who frequently plays with Nobita. Nobita
            has a crush on Shizuka; she is his prospective future wife (Nobita's future wife is initially Gian's younger
            sister). Although Gian and Suneo are Nobita's friends, they also typically bully and abuse him. Nobita
            normally responds by using Doraemon's gadgets to fight back against them, but Nobita has a tendency to get
            carried away with using the gadgets (or Gian and Suneo, if they steal it away), which typically results in
            unintended consequences for him and others.</a>

            The national flag of India, colloquially called Tiraṅgā (the tricolour), is a horizontal rectangular
            tricolour flag, the colours being of India saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a
            24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre.[1][2] It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the
            Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Union of India on 15
            "tricolour" almost always refers to the Indian national flag.

            In the 1st millennium, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's
            southern and western coasts.[42] In the early centuries of the 2nd millennium Muslim armies from Central
            Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains.[43] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India
            into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
            long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[45] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised
            religion.[46] The Mughal Empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace,[47] and
            left a rich architectural legacy.[48][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned
            India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The
            rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and
            modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A nationalist movement emerged in India, the
            first in the non-European British Empire and an influence on other nationalist movements.[54][55] Noted for
            nonviolent resistance after 1920,[56] it became the primary factor in ending British rule.[57] In 1947, the
            British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority dominion of India and
            a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration
            accompanied the partition.[58]

            India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
            pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over
            1.4 billion in 2023.[59] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to
            US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[60] India has
            become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle
            class.[61] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[62] It
            is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its
            neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[63] Among the socio-economic
            challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[64] and rising levels of air
            pollution.[65] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots. India's wildlife, which has
            traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[66] is supported in protected habitats.

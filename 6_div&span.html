        <h2>
            <span>Chhota Bheem and the Monster of Dholakpur</span>
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
            Once upon a time, there was a beautiful village called Dholakpur. A brave and kind boy named Chhota Bheem
            lived there. He was very strong and always helped the villagers whenever they were in trouble.

            Bheem loved laddoos 🍥. Whenever he ate them, he became even stronger! His best friends were Chutki, Jaggu
            the monkey, Raju, Kalia, and the twins Dholu and Bholu.

            One day, a dangerous monster attacked Dholakpur. The villagers were scared, and King Indravarma was very
            worried. Chhota Bheem stepped forward and said,
            “Don’t worry, Your Majesty. I will protect Dholakpur!”

            Bheem ate a few laddoos, gained great strength, and fought the monster bravely. After a tough battle, Bheem
            defeated the monster and saved the village 🎉

            Everyone cheered for Bheem. The king thanked him and declared,
            “Chhota Bheem is the true hero of Dholakpur!”

            Bheem celebrated with his friends and enjoyed lots of laddoos 😄

            If you want, I can tell a shorter story, a funny story, or a new adventure of Chhota Bheem!

            <span>Doraemon and the Magic Homework Gadget</span>
        </h2>
        <p align="right">
            Nobita was sitting in his room, looking very sad. His homework was unfinished again, and he was scared his
            teacher would scold him.

            Just then, Doraemon came out of his drawer and asked,
            “What happened, Nobita?”

            Nobita cried, “I can’t do my homework! It’s too hard!”

            Doraemon smiled and took out a gadget from his 4D pocket.
            “This is the Super Homework Copier!” he said.

            With the gadget, Nobita finished all his homework in minutes. He was very happy and ran outside to play with
            Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo.

            But suddenly, the gadget started copying everything too much—books, desks, even trees! The whole playground
            became a mess 😲

            Seeing the problem, Nobita felt sorry. Doraemon quickly used another gadget to fix everything.

            Doraemon said kindly,
            “Gadgets are helpful, Nobita, but you must also work hard yourself.”

            Nobita nodded and promised to study properly next time 😊

            Want a shorter Doraemon story, a funny one, or a bedtime story?

        <p align="justify">
            Nobita was a kind but lazy boy. He loved playing all day and hated doing homework. Every time he got bad
            marks, he ran to Doraemon for help.

            One day, Nobita decided,
            “I will do everything myself today!”

            He sat down to study, but it was very difficult. He wanted to cry and call Doraemon, but he didn’t give up.
            Slowly, he understood his lessons.

            Later, Gian and Suneo made fun of Nobita and challenged him to a test. To everyone’s surprise, Nobita did
            well and even beat them!

            Shizuka smiled and said,
            “Good job, Nobita!”

            Nobita felt proud and happy. When Doraemon came home, Nobita said,
            “Today I learned that trying is more important than gadgets.”

            Doraemon smiled 😊

            If you want, I can tell a funny Nobita story, a very short story, or a moral story too!
